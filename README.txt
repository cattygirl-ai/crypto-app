Bitconnect
Group 53 - Deliverable 3

About the Project
The Bitconnect system allows users to login and define trading brokers. Users can then perform a trade and get information on the trades in the form of a trading log and histogram.

Built With
* Java
  * Javaxswing

Getting Started
  To run the Bitconnect System, one will need to open Eclipse and run the Bitconnect class. This class is responsible for driving the system. A list of valid login credentials is provided in the users.txt file. The username and password are on the same line and are split by a space.

Open Issues / Future Features
  * Adding different types of graphs to represent the data
  * Retaining the user's information from a previous session once they've ended a session
